# bachelor-thesis

 Application I've written as my thesis. It's premise is to help with organizing and managing hardware and software that company can lend to its employees.
 I've decided for that topic more to put my .NET abilities to the test than to make innovative application.
 Whole paper is inside ```Thesis``` folder.
 
# Used technologies

I've used .NET Framework: C# as programming language and WPF for model of application. For database I've used Microsoft SQL Server. Used database is in ```Database``` folder.
